            <p>For every complex problem, there is a creative solution; that's where I come in.<br></br><br></br>

                My inquisitive nature recently led me to delve into the world of software engineering. With this, I bring skills in building full-stack web applications, along with nearly 20 years combined experience and expertise in Program Management, customer service/sales and cross-functional team leadership, to the dynamic field of web development.<br></br><br></br>

                My strategic mindset and attention to detail, along with my insatiable desire to learn and grow, enables me to design and develop innovative solutions for clients and businesses alike. I aim for optimization as I thrive on progress and continuous improvement, rather than perfectionism.<br></br><br></br>

                I am a self-starter, highly motivated and driven individual with a growth mindset, who embraces the challenge of not having all the answers, and is not afraid to ask for help or use resources to find them. I excel in both team environments and independent settings, ultimately finding joy in presenting a finished product that Iâ€™ve helped create.<br></br><br></br>

                I build using:<br></br><br></br>
